# Simple Web Server with Node.js

A minimalist web server built using Node.js, designed to handle HTTP requests and serve static files. This project showcases the fundamentals of server-side development with Node.js, including handling routing, managing file systems, and setting appropriate headers.

## Features

- **Serve Static Files**: Easily serve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static assets.
- **Basic Routing**: Handle different routes with simple logic.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Returns user-friendly messages for 404 errors and other issues.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Minimal dependencies, ensuring quick performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UmerI02/Simple-Web-Server-NodeJs.git
   cd Simple-Web-Server-NodeJs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies (if any):**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the server:**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. **Access the server:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your script).

## Learning Resources

This project was inspired and built by following the [Traversy Media Node.js Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8XF6AFGqlc). The video provided a strong foundation in setting up a basic server with Node.js and handling HTTP requests effectively.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Node.js Fundamentals**: Understanding of the core modules like `http`, `fs`, and `path`.
- **Routing & Middleware Concepts**: Basic implementation of routing logic.
- **File System Operations**: Reading and serving static files dynamically.
- **Error Handling**: Managing HTTP errors and providing custom responses.
